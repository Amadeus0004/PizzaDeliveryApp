# PizzaDeliveryApp
The Pizza Delivery App is a simple Java-based application designed to manage pizza delivery operations. It allows users to add delivery staff, place orders, and track the status of those orders. The application periodically saves the current state of delivery staff and orders to text files, ensuring that data is not lost between sessions.
